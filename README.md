# Mastodon Insights Mod for Steampipe

View Mastodon timelines, search hashtags, find interesting people, and check server stats.

## Overview

Mastodon dashboards answer questions like:

- Recent direct messages?
- Recent notifications?
- Recent toots on my home timeline?
- On the local timeline?
- On the federated timeline?
- Recent toots on my lists?
- Which toots are my favorites?
- How many toots have I posted? 
- Of toots have I posted, how many are original vs boosts vs replies?
- Who am I following (and which lists, if any, are they on)?
- Who are my followers (and which lists, if any, are they on) ?
- Which hashtags match `science`?
- Which toots on the home timeline match `federation`?
- Which accounts match `alice`?
- Which accounts matching `alice` am I following, and/or followed by?
- How many toots, logins, and registrations on my server in recent weeks?
- How many more API calls can I make during this 5-minute cycle?
